I am a PhD student in Agricultural and Applied Economics at the [Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/aaec/), Texas Tech University, where I am also a Research Assistant at the [Free Market Institute](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/freemarketinstitute/).

My research sits at the intersection of **complexity economics**, **network analysis**, and **institutional economics**. I use computational and quantitative methods to study how economic systems — from capital markets to innovation ecosystems — are shaped by the structure of ownership, technology, and institutional networks.

Before joining TTU, I completed my Master's in Economics at the [Institute of Economics, University of Campinas (UNICAMP)](https://www.eco.unicamp.br/), where I wrote my thesis on technology and ownership networks in the pharmaceutical sector in the age of AI. I hold a B.Sc. in Economics from [Mackenzie Presbyterian University](https://www.mackenzie.br/), where I was awarded a perfect grade for my honors thesis on the Brazilian stock market through the lens of network theory.

I am also a Research Associate at [Instituto Millenium](https://institutomillenium.org.br/), where I have contributed to country-risk and bureaucracy index projects in partnership with the [Adam Smith Center at Florida International University](https://freedom.fiu.edu/).

My work has been recognized with the **III FIESP Award in Industrial Economics – Best Master's Thesis (National)**, awarded by the Federation of Industries of the State of São Paulo in 2025.
